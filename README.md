"# python_calc" 
First of all, we have created test.py file and in that we have import sys library and package PyQt5. after that, we have set one message that
this is test file along with setting geometry of window as well as title and at the end, exit from that file. Now, for 2nd file i.e. view.py,
 we have used that PyQt5 package and in that have set GUI(view of calc) i.e. how our calc will look like and have set some main window's properties,
 the central widget and the general layout, Create the display and the buttons and set some display properties.We have used grid view for all these 
 stuff and also added some general propeties. At the end, we have created main.py file which is main file and our calc's gui will be seen over there.
 In that particular file, we have defined main function and call view function to see calc's gui. All these we have added to github by creating repository
 and using different commands to push request on master branch of that repository and also added these 3 files in that along with this readme.md file.That's it.
